## PatFolio: A Journey of Growth and Serendipity

Welcome to the PatFolio, the digital log of my life. Although it is designed to serve as a PortFolio, it is more than one; it is a hub of ideas, knowledge and discovery. Within the confines of this virtual walls, you can find a blend of my *projects*, *blog posts*, a blossoming *digital garden* and so much more!

Here, you can expect to explore the depths of my thinking as I come across and curate content that is interesting, thought provoking and possibly enlightning with an ambitious goal of topics ranging from `centering a div` to `center of human emotions`.  

I wish to keep this project, not just about me. I want it to be about connecting with like-minded individuals, who share a thirst for knowledge and growth. Together, we can exchange ideas, insights and inspire one another to greater heights.

Alright, ready to jump in?

### What is a Digital Garden?
![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/eee/aaa){ align=left }
A digital garden is a unique concept that takes the traditional notion of a blog or personal website to a whole new level. It is an *evolving collection* of thoughts, ideas, and insights that resembles a living, breathing ecosystem. In this virtual garden, information is cultivated, nurtured, and shared in an *organic* and *interconnected* manner.

Unlike a static blog, a digital garden is designed to *encourage exploration* and *discovery* or in other words, *serendipity*. It allows ideas to grow and evolve over time, just like plants in a well-tended garden. Instead of presenting fully formed articles, a digital garden embraces the *concept of "half-baked" ideas*, providing a space for *continuous learning* and *iteration*.

Within a digital garden, one can expect to find a *network of interconnected thoughts* and concepts. Each idea is like a seed planted in the soil, waiting to sprout and intertwine with other ideas. As one navigates through the garden, it is possible to follow the paths that are interesting and delve deeper into the topics that resonate, and make connections between different branches of knowledge.

By exploring a digital garden, one can become an *active participant* in the process of *knowledge creation*. It's a collaborative journey where the gardener (author) and the visitors (readers) engage in a *symbiotic relationship*, nurturing the growth of ideas together.

So step into my digital garden, wander through its pathways, and let your curiosity guide you towards a richer understanding of the world.
